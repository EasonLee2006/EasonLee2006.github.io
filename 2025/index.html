  Oh hey, so you've read the letter. 
  The letter isn't all, I still got a lot more to say.
  I'm  sorry for all of these, I really hope we can still be friends.
  
  Just like we first met, we share about our hobbies.
  Just like weeks ago, we talk about things we like and dislike;
  Just like yesterday, we chat about PJO.

  Jeez, i really wish to be your friend forever.
  But if you think i'm too clingy, I understand it.
  If you need some time or space, let me know, too.

  Don't think too much about the letter.
  This is a wonderful morning, don't ruin it. (tho i'm probably sleeping rn lol)
  
  As for the other things i want to say, I think I will save them till we chat face-to-face.
  I wish we can bring our friendship back together again.

  Anyway, Happy Valentine's~
  (my brain: that's frickin' enough. now, go to sleep)

            <strong>Dear Lydia,</strong>
            <p>
              G’morning!
              <br>You might have already guessed what this letter is about, but first things first: I owe you an apology. I'm really sorry for putting our friendship in such an awkward spot and for scaring you away by wanting you too desperately. I didn’t realize I was pushing you until I noticed you text or send memes less often. That’s when I knew I’d screwed up.
              <br><br>I foolishly thought I could handle my feelings like everything else, but I was wrong. I kept sending you reels, memes, and random questions, hoping it would go back to normal, but clearly, that wasn’t working. I should’ve been honest earlier about how I feel, but I was worried that if you didn’t feel the same, I might lose you forever (overthinking kicks in again lol).
              <br><br>Could we meet up and chat face-to-face? I’d really like us to get back to the great friendship we once had.
              <br><br>Thanks for understanding.
            </p>
