    thoughts and bullsugars (sugar for the 's' word):

    got the idea from the reels on Instagram,
    kinda fun while making this project.

    me when seeing the reel:
    "oh sugar, that might be interesting to make it by myself,
    and maybe share it with you (yes, you)."

    originally thought it'll take abt 1 or 2 hours to make a webpage like this,
    but just trying to figure out how the aligning system works already took me a few hours lol.

    after dealing with the aligning stuff, the rest of the part were comparitively easy,
    mostly the logic things and me trying to come up with some begging-lines.

    anyway, i really enjoy making this project,
    and if you have any advice or thoughts, feel free to share it with me.
    
    hope this webpage makes your day. *blushes*
